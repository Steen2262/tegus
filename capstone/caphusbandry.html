    <h3>all ages</h3>
    
    <ui>
        
        <ul>thick layer of substrate (cypress mulch, coconut coir, or a sand and soil mix)</ul>
        <ul>though most tegus like to burrow sometimes they just like to flup down in a hide you can use you can use anything from a plastic bin to a hollow log. </ul>
    <ul>75%-90% humidity</ul>
        <ul>large water tub (large enough that they can soak their entire body but not drown)</ul>
    <ul> secured well (tegus are very smart and great escape artists)</ul>
        <ul>basking spot</ul>
        <ul>Though it is debated I suggest using a UVB light, it helps with absorbing calcium and to synthesize D3</ul></ui>
        
    <h3>hatchlings</h3>
    
    <h4>Hatchlings are about 7"-10" long, but grow quickly (about an inch a month sometines more.) if cared for well, so plan for this enclosure not to last long.</h4>
   
    <ui>
        <ul>basking temp between 115 degrees f and 125 degrees f</ul>
    <ul>40 gollon breeder or a 36"x18"x17" enclosure minimum</ul>
    <ul>substrate 4" deep (cypress mulch, coconut coir, or a sand and soil mix) </ul>
    
        </ui>
    <h3>adult</h3>
    <h4>Adults can grow anywhere from 4' to 5 1/2' long </h4>
    <ui>
    <ul>because adults get so big their minimum enclosure needs to be 8'x4'x4'</ul>
        <ul>substrate needs to be 12"-24" deep</ul>
        <ul>basking temp between 125 degrees f- 140 degrees f</ul>
