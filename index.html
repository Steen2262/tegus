        <p>Tumpinambis merianae most commonly known as the black and white tegu originate from South America. Their natural enviroments range from tropical rain forests, savannas, to semi-desert.They are large reptiles growing up to 4 1/2 feet, males usually being the larger. In captivity they can live 15-20 years if well taken care of. Tegus can run at high speeds even running on their hind legs for short distances. They have long strong tails that can be used as a powerful weapon for defense. The tail can be dropped if needed, but only done as a last resort due to it stores the needed fat. Tegus  are able to raise their body temperatures about 18 degrees fahrenheit during mating season. Tegus make great pets, they are intelegent, usually docile, and form bonds with their owners. If not handled often or well they can become agressive and dangerous with a bite force of 1000n (225lb-force) as well as their powerful tail that even a minor swipe can leave a decent bruise.</p></H2>
